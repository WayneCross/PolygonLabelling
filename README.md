# PolygonLabelling

This is a labelling tool used to create annotations for Semantic Segmentation. This tool is similar to LabelMe tool.
This tool was created using python and tkinter unlike LabelMe which was created using pyqt. This tool treats a labelling as polygon hence making it very easy to create annotations for Semantic Segmentation
